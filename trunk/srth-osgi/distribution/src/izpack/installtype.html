<h3>Licensing of Snofyre's components</h3>
Some components of Snofyre contain/require SNOMED CT to work. SNOMED CT content can not be made available on
Snofyre's site, since it is owned by IHTSDO (http://www.ihtsdo.org/) and is covered by international copyright regulations."

For licensing pursposes, Snofyre's components can be grouped into:
<ul>
<li>Snofyre APP : Snofyre application itself, created using Java</li>
<li>Snofyre DATA : Test data packed with Snofyre, that contains SNOMED CT codes </li>
<li>SNOMED CT DATA : An entire release of SNOMED CT that Snofyre needs in order to do the clever things. </li>
</ul>
Snofyre cleanly separates it application components (Snofyre APP) from its data components that contain SNOMED CT encoded data.
Snofyre APP and its source code are available under an Apache 2 license at http://code.google.com/p/snofyre/
Snofyre's components that contain SNOMED CT (Snofyre DATA) and SNOMED CT itself (SNOMED CT DATA) are hosted on TRUD (http://www.uktcregistration.nss.cfh.nhs.uk).

<h3>Selecting an Installtion Type</h3>
<ul>
<li>Full Install : Choose this if you are installing Snofyre for the first time.
<li>Lite Install : Chose this option to update Snofyre application (Snofyre APP) and data (Snofyre DATA) but not SNOMED CT DATA.
    If you've previously installed Snofyre and imported SNOMED CT DATA into MySQL, then you can choose this option.

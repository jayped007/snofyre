## --- LICENSE FILE FOR Sappheiros --- #

Sappheiros is currently not licensed in any form of open source license. It is
expected that both the binaries and source code will soon be available under a variant of open
source license. Until, then Sappheiros binaries (and source files) are copyright
of NHS Connecting for Health. Any attempt to illegally reverse engineer is needless...
Please contact Jay Kola (jay.kola@nhs.net) if you would like a copy of the source code... :)
